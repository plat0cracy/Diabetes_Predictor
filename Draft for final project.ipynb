    "# Should we or how we improve those method?\n",
    " We shall first run some preliminary analysis before deploying sophisticated tools to analyse areas of interest. Our classifier model will take variables such as a person's age, bmi, smoking habits, income etc. into account to identify non-diabetic patients most at risk of acquiring diabetes. \n",
    "This can be done in several ways. For instance, the average distance of 3 nearest diabetic patients can be used to determine how likely a person is to acquire diabetes. Participants of the survey who's average distance to the 3 nearest diabetics on the graph is below a certain level can be classified most at-risk.\n",
    "Another possible method is to use K-nearest neighbors classification algorithm, although this method would be more suitable to classify someone as diabetic or non-diabetic rather than predicting which respondents are most at-risk.\n",

    "# My draft for method section\n",
    "1. we run some preliminary analysis to select the factors in raw dataset, identify the potential predictors to build our predictive classification model\n",

    "3. Then we should tune on our training dataset by cross-validation. The classifier need to pick a K value to maximize the accuracy. Thus we choose to use cross-validation. If we just split the tranining data once to evaluate, the K maybe strongly depends on the specific valiadation and sub-training dataset, which lead to be overfitting or underfitting \n",
    "4. In R, we can use the vfold_cv function to conduct cross-validation. To utilize this function, we need to  indicate the number of folds (v) and the categorical variable.\n",
