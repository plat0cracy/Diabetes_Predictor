Predictive Model for Type-2 Diabetes in **R**. [Report available here]([https://github.com/plat0cracy/Inferential-Analysis-of-Vancouver-Crime/blob/main/Analyzing%20Crime%20in%20Vancouver.ipynb](https://github.com/plat0cracy/Diabetes_Predictor/blob/main/Final%20report.pdf)).

üßπ Data Preparation: Analyzed a dataset of health indicators from ~400,000 respondents, sourced from the CDC, containing critical variables such as BMI, smoking habits, physical activity, and other health factors. Data was cleaned and wrangled to ensure accuracy for predictive modeling.

üîé Modeling Approach: Implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model to predict diabetes based on selected health factors. We employed cross-validation to determine the most effective number of neighbors (K = 15), optimizing the model's accuracy. The most impactful predictors, such as Age, BMI, Physical Health, and heart disease history, were identified and used in the model.

üìä Results: Our KNN model achieved an accuracy of 66.7% in predicting diabetes. Visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots compared the predictive model's output against actual outcomes, confirming the influence of factors like age and BMI on diabetes risk.

ü§ù Conclusions: The predictive model, while not perfect, offers significant insights into key health indicators influencing diabetes risk, which could guide preventative healthcare strategies and inform future research into less traditional risk factors.
